## Background and Motivation
The US electric power industry is undergoing a significant transformation as it strives to meet the increasing demand for electricity while simultaneously reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) collects and publishes data on energy production, consumption, and distribution in the United States. The EIA-923 report is a critical source of data for the electric power industry, providing detailed information on electricity generation, fuel consumption, and other key metrics. However, the data contained in the report is complex and challenging to work with, making it difficult to extract insights and useful information.
> The motivation for this project is to create an ETL pipeline that will enable the efficient processing and analysis of the EIA-923 data. By automating the extraction, transformation, and loading of the data, we can streamline the data processing workflow and make it easier to generate insights and actionable information.

## Objective
Specifically, the project aims to address the following key objectives:

- Extract relevant data elements from the EIA-923 report and transform them into a structured format that is suitable for analysis and modeling.
- Standardize the data and ensure that it is consistent, accurate, and complete.
- Load the transformed data into a data warehouse or database that can be easily queried and analyzed.
- Develop a user-friendly interface for accessing and querying the data, enabling users to generate reports and visualizations that can support decision-making.
- Provide quick insight on the dataset \
> Overall, our project aims to make it easier for researchers, policymakers, and businesses to access and analyze the EIA-923 data, which is critical for understanding the US electric power industry and developing strategies to optimize energy production and distribution. By providing a standardized and streamlined data processing workflow, we hope to make it easier for stakeholders to generate insights and actionable information that can support their work.
